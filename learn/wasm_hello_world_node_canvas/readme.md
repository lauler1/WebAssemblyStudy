# Welcome to wasm_hello_world_node_canvas

Back to [home](../readme.md)

This is an example of how to use the node canvas to access webgl. It does not use wasm, but this can be a way to understand how to create GUI with wasm using Nodejs outside the Browser.


It needs [Node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).

To build and test it, use:
```bash
#Linux native libs, if not installed yet:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev

npm install gl

npm install gifencoder

npm install three

npm install canvas

#To run:
node threejs.js

```
